Typing
======

Satella contains some expressions to help you with typing.
You import them from `satella.coding.typing`.
They are as follows:

* `ExceptionClassType` - base type of exception class
* `Number` - an amalgam of int and float
* `T`, `U`, `K`, `V` - type vars to use
* `Iteratable` - a generic iterator or an iterable of `T`
