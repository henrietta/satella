Satella is a Python library for writing server applications, especially those dealing with
small network-oriented tasks. Over time it will constitute a reasonably large library with useful things.

Satella regards network sockets as sockets, just the way the are, taking into consideration the multitude
of ways they can fail. Other libraries tend to abstract them away as files. This library allows you to use the abstractions you see fit - whether it's a select loop or thread-per-connection, or even mixing the paradigms. 

Satella is easy-to-use. It's main task is to reduce the cognitive load on the programmer. It requires minimum-to-none startup and faciliates it's objects, classes and procedures to be used without requiring the coder to read and understand multitude information about unnecessary far-away classes. Code written is simple and concise.
